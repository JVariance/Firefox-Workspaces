A Browser Extension for Firefox which lets you organize your tabs into workspaces similar to Opera Ones workspaces. It's an alternative to Firefox' "Multi Account Containers"-Feature, which requires reauthentication on websites inside every single container.

- [activate previous windows and tab opening on startup](about:preferences#browserRestoreSession)

    - New Workspace: Ctrl+Alt+D
    - Switch to next Workspace: Ctrl+Alt+X
    - Switch to previuos Workspace: Ctrl+Alt+Y
 - Send multiple (selected) tabs to new/other workspace

### Potential implementation in future releases

 - History per window/workspace
